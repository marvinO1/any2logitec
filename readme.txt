The "Jekins to Gamepad" project for NCA Code Camp 2013. Actually we want to 
display any 4 line information on the pad. Jekins would only be one source. 

The whole solution should be language independent. So any device that can 
produce a 4 line file can act as a message producer.

We implemented a little messaging application which can send information to 
the display as receiving messages from the buttons. Doing this we defined a 
simple protocol and implemented a file based version.

   %LOGITEC_DISPLAY_FOLDER_ROOT%/inbound is the folder where we can 
   place messages which then get displayed by the pad. Each message producer 
   uses its unique feed name to produce files, for instance
   
      jenkins.10.0.messages
      tagi.10.0.messages
      
   The very left part references the feed name (such as jenkins, tagi), the 
   first number the time in seconds the message should be displayed at least 
   and the second number is the correlationId of the message. The postfix
   message is only used to identify the file as a message file.
      
    %LOGITEC_DISPLAY_FOLDER_ROOT%/outbound it the folder where the 
    pad places files when one of the four pad buttons have been pressed. 
    The names of the files have following pattern
    
      <full name of the last consumed inbound file>.bn.pressed
      
     For example: jenkins.10.0.messages.b0.pressed is the file produced 
     when the very left button is pressed, after the message from jenkins was 
     consumed.
     
    %LOGITEC_DISPLAY_FOLDER_ROOT%/cfg contains for each adapter 
    the property file used for configuration. 
     
      jenkins.prop 
        jenkins.api.url=http://localhost:8080/jenkins/api/xml?depth=1
        
      tagi.prop
        tagi.rss_ticker.url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/rss_ticker.html
        
    We use separated files to avoid any name clashes and also to follow
    the plug in concept.     
     
     
The class nca.any2logitec.impl.LogitectHub is the main class representing the 
java based hub. It contains also the configuration for the jekins and tagi 
adapters. Currently we do not have a installation script for for the java 
part. 

In the folder cpp you find the c++ programm which talks to the game pad through
the provided API from logitec. See also 
http://www.logitech.com/de-ch/support/7246?crid=411&osid=14&bit=64 for more
details on that.

The logitecHub.7z contains the C++ executable. After you have installed the
software for the Logitec G510 unzip the file at any location and run the exe.
